# Only allow one build per branch at a time except on main.
# This takes advantage of the lazy evaluation of the "||" operator. When the ref is main
# the run_number will be included in the concurrency group making it unique but when
# the ref is not main it will evaluate to false and the second half of the operator is
# never evaluated, so the group is the same for all runs on that pr/branch.
